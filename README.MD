This repo shows how to start create a webpage with classic setup where we stitch together -

- An HTML file for the markup.
- A JavaScript file for scripting/functions.
- A CSS file for styling.

and no fancy transpiler or builder.
The main branch shows the vanilla setup and the output can be accessed at
